Module 7: Geographic Visualizations In Tableau

Case Study I- Problem Statement

Problem Statement:

You have been hired by Gear Valves, a cycle manufacturing company currently operating in three continents.
The management wants you to create a few map charts to help them analyze their data. With the help of Maps,
create the following visualizations: -

1. By default, the Continent is not a geographical location. Convert it to a geographical location and create a filled
  map that will display the name and sales of each Continent.
  
2. Create a dual-axis chart wherein the first Map displays the sum of sales at the Country level and in the second map,
   color of each mark represents its Continent and the size of each mark represents the average of annual income of that Country.
   
3. Create a Map depicting Profit in each Country. Using Tableau Web Mapping Service (WMS), create a Satellite Map.

4. Management has provided a Spatial file named as Brimbank Road Network. Connect to the file and create a
   Map where color displays the class of the road and on hovering, the name of the road should be displayed.
   
5. Connect to a different spatial file named as Brimbank Open Space Trees, and provide visualization where the
   color of each mark represents its location and size represents its census.
   
Refer to the following files:
Dataset: Green Valves.csv

Spatial Files: BrimbankRoadNetwork.shp, BrimbankOpenSpaceTress.shp
