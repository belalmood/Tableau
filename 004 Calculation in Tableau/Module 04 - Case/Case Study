Create attractive and informative visualizations. Using Table calculations, create the following charts: -

1. Create a chart to visualize the Running Total of Sales over a period of time.
   Create an Area chart and compare the Running Total Sales with the Actual Sales.

2. Create a Text table to show the percentage difference in Profit of each month in comparison with the previous year’s month.

3. Create a Text Table to show the Running Sum of Profit for every year individually.

4. Using features like Rank, Last and Index create a chart to highlight the Top 5 and Bottom 5 sub-categories based on the sales.

5. Create a chart to display the moving average of sales of 6 months prior and 6 months after.
   Using this information, the management will have an idea about the one-year average of sales over a period of time.
