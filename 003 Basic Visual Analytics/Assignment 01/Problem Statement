so that it is easy for the director to see the exact value rather than calculating all the values.

considered as IT companies by the management: -
   • Computer Hardware
   • IT Services
   • Software
   • Telecommunications

3. Create a Target Quadrant for the management based on Company Name, 2018 Expense, 2018 Revenue.
The values of 2018 Expense and 2018 Revenue should be fixed at 10,000,000 and 18,000,000. The quadrant should also be able
to Highlight the top 5 Companies based on the 2018 growth percentage as this gives insight to the management in selecting the
companies to invest in.
