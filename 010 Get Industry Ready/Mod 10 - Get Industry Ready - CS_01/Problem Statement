Problem Statement:

The Management at Green Eco has asked you to create the following dashboards which will assist them in expanding their business.

Refer the datasets: Adventure Works.csv, Location.csv, Product.csv and Sales.xls

Q1: Create a Switch between fields in Bar Chart, where user can select Dimensions and Measures dynamically and the whole sheet should also change accordingly.
    Use the following fields: -
      ➢ Dimensions: Country, Category Name and Subcategory Name.
      ➢ Measures: Sales and Profit.

Q2: Create a Dashboard where the user has an option to select one chart and the other should disappear.
    For this create two separate line charts one with Date and Sales and another with Date and Profit.

Q3: Create a Dashboard where the user can dynamically change the charts using an option button.
    Create one Pie chart showing the Total Percent of Sales by each Country and another should be a crosstab of Pie chart.

Q4: Create a Bar Graph which shows only top 5 relevant sub-categories by Sales, once the category selected.
